JMDlx:
* OS9 - Find a build box
* Fix The Timing/ Speed up/ slow down/ pause [speed in jmlib]
* Command-line named pattern
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Fix OSX proxy stuff
* 

AAJM:
* Find more stupid uses and add to webpage

JMCocoa:
* Finish it

JMLib 2.1:

BUGS

JuggleSaver
* Cannot toggle spin on and off for JuggleSaver
* Some JuggleSaver patterns are loaded twice
* Pattern parsing: * -1 not parsed correctly
* Timing is strange
* Site validator a-z / A-Z not parsed properly

JuggleMaster
* Club spinning is strange while holding for certain patterns
* Clubs are held too low for certain patterns
* Pattern parsing not safe for incorrect pattern files
* Integrate timing functionality (JUGGLEMASTER_NEW_TIMING)
* Camera placement is wrong for JuggleMaster patterns that include
  a-z in their siteswap. Corresponding JuggleSaver pattern should
  have uppercase A-Z.

CLEANUP

* Add documentation to headers

NEW STUFF AND ENHANCEMENTS

OpenGL Stuff
* Add font support (pattern display & fps counter) (OPENGL_FONT_SUPPORT)
* Rotate function
* Load new pattern without changing 
* Flat OpenGL rendering for JuggleMaster plus switching
* Flat OpenGL rendering for JuggleSaver (?)
  (fixed camera, white background, black stick figure, balls only, no shadows)
* Flat rendering enhancements:
  - inverted color scheme
  - background image or background gradient (like jmlib-js)
* Better / smoother camera control

SQL Pattern loader
* Get random pattern from library
* Load pattern with style
* Pattern navigation: next/prev pattern/category

Misc
* Mixed object type
* Select object type when loading pattern
* Load / Save camera stuff
* JuggleMaster pattern file additions:
  - Object types: Mixed, Balls, Rings, Clubs
  - camera placement
  - Embed JuggleSaver patterns
* Switch to random pattern
* sqlite pattern loading / search
* Currently active throw for JuggleSaver
* fps counter
* Currently active pattern info on screen
* Bounce juggler's head for JuggleMaster patterns


IFDEF documentation
* JUGGLESAVER_SUPPORT - Turns on JuggleSaver support and JuggleSaver rendering engine
* OPENGL_ES_SUPPORT - Compile all OpenGL functionality in OpenGL ES compatibility mode. Requires JUGGLESAVER_SUPPORT
* JUGGLEMASTER_OPENGL_SUPPORT - Turns on flat OpenGL rendering for JuggleMaster. Automatically turned on with JUGGLESAVER_SUPPORT. Use this to get simple 2D OpenGL support without JuggleSaver compatibility
* SMALL_MEMORY_DEVICE - Reduces memory requirement of JuggleMaster at the expense of losing compatibility for patterns with 630 balls. Should be unneccesary for most platforms, currently only used in the Palm OS version.

Other:
* JMWIN - Enabled in JMWin, required for proper OpenGL support on that platform. Don't use for other platforms.

STUFF FOR THE FUTURE

* Add fish club and other objects
* Skinning for the juggler
* Stop the juggler's arms crossing
* Add "bugger up" feature where dude drops all the balls.
* Add a sync-de-sync option (?)
