JuggleMaster


Uhm. Not sure what I can say here, really. It's a juggling siteswap
animator. If you know what that is and think you want one, here's a
really cool one for Linux, Windows, and some others.

If you don't know you want one, you can run it and just delve about in
the "Choose Pattern" menus, looking at the pretty things you could tell
the program to do if you understood siteswap.

And if you want to learn siteswap, http://www.siteswap.org/ looks to be
a pretty decent resource.


To build, just go into the src/jmdlx dir and type "make". It creates a
binary "jmdlx". Run it. You need wxWindows. To build it on windows either
work it out yourself, or extract bloodshed.zip and use the excellent
DevC++ from www.bloodshed.net

To build on OSX, go into src/jmdlx and type "make osx". It'll create
JuggleMaster.app right there.

If you don't have patterns.jm and semaphore.jm in the current dir when
you run it, it attempts to download them and save them to a suitable
dir. You'll find copies in the "data" dir, so you can just copy them
across if you want.


In the "docs" dir, you'll find Ken Matsuoka's original README, and Isaac
Orr's readme from the Java version [which has a better description of
how to edit the pattern files].


And finally, because I'm incapable of producing anything without some
kind of misabuse of it, this program includes things like Semaphores [that
thing with the flags, not the resource control], a maximum of 630 balls
instead of everyone else's 35, and probably some other stuff I've
forgotten about.
