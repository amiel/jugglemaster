AAJM README


Uhm, Right. If you haven't worked out what this is from the name, you
should seriously consider that it may not be of any interest to you.


Run it. Purty. Other things that may or may not work include:
AAOPTS="-driver slang -width 240 -height 150" \
	xterm -fn micro -geometry 240x150 -e ./aajm -s 7


This fella: http://homepage.smc.edu/kennedy_john/
and Abrash supplied the algorithms for the aa_ series of files here.


Other ways of running it may include adding this to /etc/services:
aajm            55001/tcp # AAJM !

and this to /etc/inetd.conf:
aajm    stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  aajm

and restarting inetd with "kill -HUP `cat /var/run/inetd.pid`"
then telnetting to that host on port 55001:
telnet localhost 55001
