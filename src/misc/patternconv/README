README for patternconv

This is a simple script that generates a pattern library file for jmlib-js
from the pattern file found in data/patterns.jm

The output file is written to this directory as patterns.js. Copy it to
src/jmlib-js to use.

The implementation uses src/jmlib/patterns.cpp and src/jmlib/validator.cpp
