README for jmwidget

jmwidget is an implementation of JuggleMaster as a Widget.
It currently runs as an Opera Widget and as a Dashboard Widget.

For now, the widget files must be packaged manually. This will be
handled by a script in due time.

- Scan index.html:

Replace
<script src="../validator.js"></script>
<script src="../jmlib.js"></script>	
<script src="../jugglemaster.js"></script>

With:

<script src="jmlib-js/jmlib.js"></script>	
<script src="jmlib-js/jugglemaster.js"></script>
