How to build JMPalm with Sony support

JMPalm must be built with Sony support headers in order to be
compatible with the soft silk screen (dia) on Sony devices.

The included makefile is set up to build with Sony headers,
which are assumed to be located in a subdirectory named sony.
Edit the makefile, and set SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATHS to point to
the correct place if your headers are located elsewhere.

SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATHS = -Isony/R5.0/Incs -Isony/R5.0/Incs/Libraries -Isony/R5.0/Incs/System -Isony/R5.0/Incs/System/etc

To turn off Sony support, remove the SONY_SUPPORT define in
the makefile:

DEFINES = SONY_SUPPORT

You need Sony SDK 5.0 headers. They do not work correctly with
PRC-TOOLS of the box. 

The problem is that the headers define system traps via enums,
which is not supported by PRC-TOOLS. You need to change these
to use #defines instead:

Change:

typedef enum tagHRTrapNumEnum
{
	HRTrapGetAPIVersion = sysLibTrapCustom,
	HRTrapWinClipRectangle,
	HRTrapWinCopyRectangle,
...
} HRTrapNumEnum;

To:

#define	HRTrapGetAPIVersion (sysLibTrapCustom+0)
#define	HRTrapWinClipRectangle (sysLibTrapCustom+1)
#define	HRTrapWinCopyRectangle (sysLibTrapCustom+2)
...

Search for sysLibTrapCustom in all headers, and change
accordingly. Once all system traps definitions are changed
to use #defines, you should be able to compile with Sony
support turned on.
