changes.txt

This file contains a list of changes in each version of JMPalm.
The newest version is listed first.

See the file todo.txt for information on features that might
be added in a future release of JMPalm.

** 1.2 (01.08.2006)

- Now open source!
- Full support for Palm OS 5.0 high resolution and soft silk screen
- Hands are drawn properly instead of just being squares
- Landscape mode
- Now runs without a pattern library present
- Updated to use new open source jmlib. Incompatible patterns in the
  old version work fine now.
- Removed Beam function (it never functioned properly anyway)
- Show current pattern and site on screen when paused
- Misc cleanup to make everything C++ compatible
- Massive source cleanup. Removed several halfway implemented features

** 1.1 (31.03.2002)

- Any previously selected category and pattern is remembered in
  "Select Pattern."
- Added "Center" style to selectable styles in "Enter Siteswap."
- "20-Ball Columns A/B" in "Are You God?" category disabled. These
  patterns cause JMPalm to hang.
- Fixed a memory leak bug.
- The juggler will no longer show when switching between pages in
  "Preferences"

** 1.0 (31.10.2001)

- Miscellaneous GUI cleanup. Some elements that weren't implemented
  have been removed from the screen.
- Fixed a bug which caused incorrect hand placement for vanilla siteswaps
  with a '2' as the second throw.
- Implemented "Height Ratio Reduction" setting.

** 0.3 (03.08.2001)

- Mirror pattern setting added
- File format has changed (database files are now much smaller)
- JMC (JuggleMaster Pattern Converter) released. This allows you to compile
  your own list of patterns to use on JMPalm. (downloaded separately).
- Added an "Info" button in the "Select Pattern" form.
- All speedup bugs should be gone for good.
- Attempting to load an incorrect pattern will no longer leave
  rubbish on screen on PalmOS version prior to 3.5
- Full color support added (finally!)
- Preferences are now saved and loaded
- Hard buttons are now fully configurable. The default configuration
  is to use the up and down buttons for speed up and down
  respectively.
- Rudimentary speed tweaking added.
- The shortcut buttons in "Enter Siteswap" now insert text at the cursor,
  and replaces any selected text.
- Added a "Beam" option. This will beam JMPalm and its database to another
  Palm. This is untested (I don't have a second palm around right now), so
  it may very well not work properly.

** 0.2 (14.01.2001)

- Full JuggleMaster pattern library included
  (database format has changed)
- The juggler's head is now drawn as an outline.
- Fixed ball placement bugs.
- Added a splash screen.
- Added a "Loading Pattern" message which is shown whenever
  a pattern is loaded or a siteswap entered.
- Added color icons for Palm IIIc and Visor Prism.
- Shortcut buttons for ()[],x in Enter Siteswap.
- It is now possible to set height and dwell ratio in
  Enter Siteswap.

** 0.12 (28.11.2000)

- Fixed a bug that prevented version 0.11 from running on
  non PalmOS 3.5 devices.

** 0.11 (27.11.2000)

- Fixed a bug that caused some palms to crash during or after
  hotsync of the program.

** 0.1 (27.11.2000)

- Initial beta release
