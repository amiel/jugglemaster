JuggleMaster Torquescript

What is it?

It's a reimplementation of jmlib in the language Torquescript - the
runtime scripting language using in the Torque Game Engine, from
http://www.garagegames.com

It was my first exercise in learning torquescript, and I originally
wrote it to work with Torque Game Builder [back then, it was actually
Torque2D].
